# Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S?
#s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]}
s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]}
# response from chatgpt !!
# No, you cannot create a set s that contains a list (or any other mutable object) in Python.
# This is because sets can only contain immutable (hashable) elements,
#  and lists are mutable (they can be changed after creation).
